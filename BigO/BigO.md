<h1>BigO notation</h1>

<h2>What is BigO notation?</h2>

<p>BigO notation is a way to measure the performance of an algorithm. It is a way to describe how fast an algorithm is. It is a way to measure how much time an algorithm takes to run.</p>

<h2>Why is BigO notation important?</h2>

<p>BigO notation is important because it allows us to compare different algorithms and see which one is better. It allows us to see which algorithm is more efficient.</p>

<h2>How to calculate BigO notation?</h2>

<p>BigO notation is calculated by counting the number of operations an algorithm performs as the size of the input increases.</p>

<h3>constant time</h3>

<p>For example, if we have an array of size 5 and we want to print the first two elements of the array, we would have to perform two operations. If we have an array of size 10 and we want to print the first two elements of the array, we would have to perform two operations. If we have an array of size 100 and we want to print the first two elements of the array, we would have to perform two operations. No matter how big the array is, we would always have to perform two operations. This is called constant time. We would say that the BigO notation of this algorithm is O(1).</p>

<h3>linear time</h3>

<p>If we have an array of size 5 and we want to print all the elements of the array, we would have to perform five operations. If we have an array of size 10 and we want to print all the elements of the array, we would have to perform ten operations. If we have an array of size 100 and we want to print all the elements of the array, we would have to perform 100 operations. The number of operations increases linearly as the size of the input increases. This is called linear time. We would say that the BigO notation of this algorithm is O(n).</p>

<h3>quadratic time</h3>

<p>If we have an array of size 5 and we want to print all the elements of the array, we would have to perform 25 operations. If we have an array of size 10 and we want to print all the elements of the array, we would have to perform 100 operations. If we have an array of size 100 and we want to print all the elements of the array, we would have to perform 10,000 operations. The number of operations increases quadratically as the size of the input increases. This is called quadratic time. We would say that the BigO notation of this algorithm is O(n^2).</p>

<h3>logarithmic time</h3>

<p>If we have an array of size 5 and we want to find the index of an element in the array, we would have to perform 3 operations. If we have an array of size 10 and we want to find the index of an element in the array, we would have to perform 4 operations. If we have an array of size 100 and we want to find the index of an element in the array, we would have to perform 7 operations. The number of operations increases logarithmically as the size of the input increases. This is called logarithmic time. We would say that the BigO notation of this algorithm is O(log n).</p>

<h3>exponential time</h3>

<p>If we have an array of size 5 and we want to find all the possible combinations of the elements in the array, we would have to perform 32 operations. If we have an array of size 10 and we want to find all the possible combinations of the elements in the array, we would have to perform 1024 operations. If we have an array of size 100 and we want to find all the possible combinations of the elements in the array, we would have to perform 1,267,650,600,228,229,401,496,703,205,376 operations. The number of operations increases exponentially as the size of the input increases. This is called exponential time. We would say that the BigO notation of this algorithm is O(2^n).</p>

<h2>What is the difference between BigO notation and BigTheta notation?</h2>

<p>BigO notation is used to describe the worst case scenario of an algorithm. BigTheta notation is used to describe the average case scenario of an algorithm.</p>

<h2>What is the difference between BigO notation and BigOmega notation?</h2>

<p>BigO notation is used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm. BigOmega notation is used to describe the lower bound of an algorithm.</p>
